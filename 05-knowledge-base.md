## Best Practices for Knowledge Base Management

1. **Keep information up-to-date**: Regularly review and update your knowledge base, especially for time-sensitive information like application deadlines or course offerings.

2. **Use natural language**: Phrase information in a way that matches how users actually ask questions.

3. **Cover variations**: Include different ways of asking the same question to improve matching.

4. **Be comprehensive**: Ensure your knowledge base covers all aspects of your organization's operational process, from application requirements to campus life.

5. **Organize logically**: Structure your knowledge base in a way that makes sense for your organization and the types of questions you expect.

6. **Monitor and improve**: Regularly review unanswered questions and add that information to your knowledge base.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chatbot gives incorrect answers**: Review and update the specific knowledge base entry.

2. **Chatbot can't find information**: Add the missing information or rephrase existing entries.

3. **Duplicate or conflicting information**: Consolidate entries and ensure consistency.

4. **File upload errors**: Check file format and size, then try again.
