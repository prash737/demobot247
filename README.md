# API Documentation

## Introduction to the Bot247 API

The Bot247 API allows developers to programmatically interact with the platform, enabling custom integrations, automations, and extensions. This section provides comprehensive documentation for using the API effectively.

**Note**: API access is available exclusively to Pro and Advanced plan subscribers.

## Getting Started

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key:

1.  Generate an API key in your Bot247 dashboard:
    -   Navigate to "Settings" > "API"
    -   Click "Generate New API Key"
    -   Name your key (e.g., "Website Integration")
    -   Set permissions as needed
    -   Click "Create"

2.  Include your API key in all requests:
    -   As a header: \`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\`
    -   Or as a query parameter: \`?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY\`

### Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

\`\`\`
https://api.bot247.live/v1
\`\`\`

### Response Format

All API responses are in JSON format and include:

-   \`status\`: Success or error
-   \`data\`: The requested data (if successful)

## Webhook Integration

Bot247 supports webhooks to notify your systems of important events:

### Register Webhook

\`\`\`
POST /webhooks
\`\`\`

Registers a new webhook endpoint.

**Request Body:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
  "events": ["conversation.created", "conversation.completed"],
  "chatbot_id": "cb_123456789"
}
\`\`\`

**Example Response:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "wh_123456",
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["conversation.created", "conversation.completed"],
    "chatbot_id": "cb_123456789",
    "created_at": "2023-07-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Webhook Events

Bot247 can send the following events to your webhook endpoint:

-   \`conversation.created\`: When a new conversation starts
-   \`conversation.completed\`: When a conversation ends
-   \`conversation.feedback\`: When a user provides feedback
-   \`knowledge.updated\`: When the knowledge base is updated
-   \`chatbot.status_changed\`: When a chatbot's status changes

### Webhook Payload Example

\`\`\`json
{
  "event": "conversation.completed",
  "chatbot_id": "cb_123456789",
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": "conv_123456",
    "duration": 240,
    "message_count": 8,
    "topics": ["Inquiries", "Key Dates"],
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:34:00Z"
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

-   \`200 OK\`: Request succeeded
-   \`201 Created\`: Resource created successfully
-   \`400 Bad Request\`: Invalid request parameters
-   \`401 Unauthorized\`: Invalid or missing API key
-   \`403 Forbidden\`: Insufficient permissions
-   \`404 Not Found\`: Resource not found
-   \`429 Too Many Requests\`: Rate limit exceeded
-   \`500 Internal Server Error\`: Server-side error

Error responses include detailed information:

\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The parameter 'period' must be one of: day, week, month, year",
    "details": {
      "parameter": "period",
      "value": "quarter",
      "allowed_values": ["day", "week", "month", "year"]
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limits:

-   Pro Plan: 60 requests per minute
-   Advanced Plan: 120 requests per minute

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

-   \`X-RateLimit-Limit\`: Total requests allowed per minute
-   \`X-RateLimit-Remaining\`: Remaining requests in the current window
-   \`X-RateLimit-Reset\`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)

## Best Practices

1.  **Use Pagination**: When retrieving large datasets, use pagination parameters to improve performance.

2.  **Handle Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff when rate limits are reached.

3.  **Webhook Reliability**: Ensure your webhook endpoint responds with a 200 status code quickly to acknowledge receipt.

4.  **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage API failures gracefully.

5.  **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls.

## Code Examples

### JavaScript/Node.js

\`\`\`javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const API_KEY = 'your_api_key';
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.bot247.live/v1';

async function getChatbots() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/chatbots`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': \`Bearer ${API_KEY}\`
      }
    });
    
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching chatbots:', error.response?.data || error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usage
getChatbots()
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
\`\`\`

### Python

\`\`\`python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
BASE_URL = 'https://api.bot247.live/v1'

def get_chatbots():
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(f'{BASE_URL}/chatbots', headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for 4XX/5XX responses
    
    return response.json()

# Example usage
try:
    chatbots = get_chatbots()
    print(chatbots)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error fetching chatbots: {e}")
